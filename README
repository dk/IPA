DESCRIPTION
===========

IPA stands for Image Processing Algorithms and represents
the library of image processing operators and functions.
IPA is based on the Prima toolkit ( http://www.prima.eu.org ),
which in turn is a perl-based graphic library. IPA is
designed for solving image analysis and object recognition
tasks with perl.

SOURCE DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
================================

Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using perl
and then run make ( or gmake, or nmake for Win32 and OS/2):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If some of the required libraries or include files can not
be found, INCPATH+=/some/include and LIBPATH+=/some/lib semantics
should be used to tell Makefile.PL about these.

To install into a private library, for example your home
directory:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/lib/perl

Look in Makefile.PL for further details.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visit http://www.prima.eu.org/IPA for the recent versions
of the library. The mailing list on the library is avialable,
you can ask questions there. See the homepage for details.
